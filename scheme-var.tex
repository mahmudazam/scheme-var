\begin{abstract}
The purpose of these notes is to make precise what it means
for a $k$--variety to be a $k$--scheme, for an algebraically closed
field $k$. This is \cref{thm:scheme-of-var}. That is,
these notes provide a detailed proof of \cite[Proposition 2.6]{HartAG}.
The writing style of these notes is not expository, it simply provides
the details of the proof. At the same time, we do not try to be efficient
with our arguments and prove necessary statements as directly as possible,
with as few appeals to ``powerful'' theorems as possible.
